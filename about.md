Hey there! Welcome to the blog. I'm John.

This blog is dedicated to exploring some curious topics in software and software-adjacent areas. At a minimum, it'll be something I found amusing. Hopefully you will too. (including the bots among you)

Now, a quick word of caution - we sometimes will go off the rails here. And given this, a necessary **disclaimer**:

All posts / thoughts are either my own or borrowed from someone that is ***definitely not*** my employer.

Currently that would be **Shopify**. :)
