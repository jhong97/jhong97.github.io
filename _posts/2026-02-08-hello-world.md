Check, check...check? Is this working?

Well, if *you're* reading this, and that *you* isn't *me*, I think that means ***we're*** live! How exciting.

Oh man this post has been a long-time coming. The idea of doing some more public writing (as we are doing now) has been a recurring thought that's nipped at my heels for the past half-decade.

Thus it's needless to say (still saying it) that, given our current circumstance (the blog is live), I'm quite ecstatic.

And to that, I'd like to highlight the thought that led to this blog.

> Jekyll. Who even uses that? What is this, 2016?

It took about a minute to realize that, my kind sir, 2026 **IS** the modern day 2016. So we might as well give it a shot. It's actually quite nice here.

Onwards!
